<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grape Harvesters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pivotal Striker</li><li>Trunk Shaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The grape harvesters market is primarily divided into two types: pivotal strikers and trunk shakers. Pivotal strikers utilize a mechanical arm that strikes the grape bunches, causing them to fall into a collecting system. This method is efficient for vineyards with varied terrain. In contrast, trunk shakers vibrate the entire vine trunk, facilitating grape harvest from multiple rows simultaneously. Each type has distinct advantages regarding efficiency, grape preservation, and suitability for different vineyard sizes and layouts.</p></p>
