<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Disposable Soft Tissue Dissection Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar</li><li>Monopolar</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The disposable soft tissue dissection device market is primarily segmented into bipolar and monopolar types. Bipolar devices use two electrodes to deliver energy directly at the tissue site, minimizing thermal spread and offering precise dissection, making them ideal for delicate procedures. In contrast, monopolar devices utilize a single electrode connected to a generator, allowing for broader tissue treatment but often resulting in greater thermal effects. Both types cater to different surgical needs, enhancing safety and efficacy in soft tissue manipulation.</p></p>
