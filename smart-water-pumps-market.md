<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Water Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pump</li><li>Positive Displacement Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The smart water pumps market is primarily categorized into two types: centrifugal pumps and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move water through the impeller, making them ideal for high-flow applications with low viscosity liquids. In contrast, positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed volume of liquid and forcing it through the discharge, making them suitable for high-viscosity fluids and precise flow control. Both types are increasingly integrated with smart technologies for enhanced efficiency and monitoring.</p></p>
