<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cranial Perforators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thin Bone Area</li><li>Thick Bone Area</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cranial perforators market is categorized into two main types based on bone density: thin bone areas and thick bone areas. Thin bone area perforators are designed for use in regions with lower bone density, such as the frontal and temporal bones. They require precision and minimal force to avoid damage. In contrast, thick bone area perforators, suitable for denser regions like the parietal and occipital bones, are built to handle greater resistance and may feature more robust designs for efficient drilling.</p></p>
